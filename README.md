<b><h3>Web development with HTML, CSS and JS using Bootstrap as framework</h3></b>

This is a first personal project to develop a landing page to display information and collect responses in a form for an event. Is a simple page in 3 languages using Bootstrap as framework for the front end with custom JavaScrip for some functionalities.

All the content is included on the index.html file with references to the script.js and styles.css. In the font and image folders the static elements are present to be loaded.

The content of the page is displayed using Netlify on https://kike-shintya.netlify.app/
